# Prioritized Development Backlog

IDs `B-<phase>-<n>`. Priority P0/P1/P2 within phase. Each item lists requirement refs and acceptance
(tests). Estimates in ideal engineer-days (d). Scope follows the MVP vertical slice (ADR-0036) delivered in
the checkpoint order of ADR-0044 (see `01-implementation-roadmap.md` §0 for the phase → checkpoint map).
Items marked **[CP7]** were moved out of the first proof of the core loop (API, web UI, Temporal bootstrap).

| B-2-4 | P0 | SeriesPlanning + PlanningHorizon workflows; promise scheduling; plan validators; cadence checks; Active Constraint Set per chapter | FR-3.1–3.8 | contracts validate; stale on material commits | 8d |
| B-2-5 | P0 | ChapterProduction workflow: preflight (previous-chapter gate before spend, ADR-0046), scene plan (register pre-resolution), scene writer loop with **output-language gate**, assembler, deterministic checks — delivered slice (remainder: Concept/SeriesPlanning/broader evaluator set stay open) | FR-4.1–4.4, FR-4.10 | happy path w/ mock; Korean-output mock rejected | 6d |

| B-2-7 | P0 | RevisionWorkflow: dimension-targeted revisers, patch application, regression re-checks (no cross-dimension regression), limits, escalation | FR-5.5/5.6, FR-6.8 | T1–T6, T18, T23–T25 repaired at spec'd scope; T17 escalates | 6d |
| B-2-8 | P0 | CanonCommit child workflow (extract ∥, reconcile, adjudicate, verify, commit, edge promotion, post-commit) — delivered slice: single-path extract → deterministic verify → atomic commit → L1 summary/index/edges (parallel reconcile/adjudicate/post-commit orchestration stays open) | FR-7.2–7.4 | fixture deltas | 4d |
| B-2-9 | P0 | Gates per mode with per-dimension policy approval; signals approve/reject/request-changes/override constrained by the override matrix; change_request_interpreter | FR-4.9, ADR-0019/0041/0042 | workflow tests; `never`-class cannot be approved | 4d |
| B-2-10 | P0 | Batch workflow; pause/cancel/resume; leases; stale-canon re-validation — delivered slice: deterministic `workflowId`, `runStep`/`job_steps` idempotent resume, `failAfterStep` proof (T19), global-identity collision proof (T19b); broader jobs/pause/resume belongs to Checkpoint 7 where the roadmap places it | FR-4.7, FR-7.12/7.13, NFR-B | chaos cases | 4d |

## Phase 3 — UI **[CP7]** (after the core loop is proven, ADR-0044)

| ID | P | Item | Refs | Est |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| B-3-9 | P1 | Retcon/regeneration flows with dependency reports | UW-9, 10 | 3d |

## Checkpoint 6 — Quality and long-form validation (additions)

Status for these four items is recorded in `09-progress.md` (ADR-0043), including where delivery is
narrower than the wording below. B-6-1 now covers three chapters (ch.1 → ch.2 → ch.3). B-6-3 grows the
corpus but does **not** run the judge calibration, which is B-4-5. B-6-4 delivers enforceable N-candidate
selection; default production under `standard.v1` still generates one candidate.

| ID | P | Item | Refs | Acceptance | Est |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B-6-1 | P0 | Multi-chapter continuity test on the fixture (ch.1 → ch.2 → … remembers committed state, tail and hook) | brief §10 | pack contains k−1 summary/tail/hook/deltas; ch.2 draft cites ch.1 state | 4d |
| B-6-2 | P0 | Failure-recovery tests: commit fault, stale canon, provider fault, resume from checkpoint | NFR-B | no partial canon; exactly-once bump | 3d |
| B-6-3 | P0 | Grow the contrast set from the 4 starter sets to ≥ 40 original, diverse sets (all four MVP genres × functions: hook, emotional beat, banter, status window, reveal, ending, exposition, action) with expectations; no filler | ADR-0043, ADR-0029 | validator count check; judge calibration run recorded | 6d |
| B-6-4 | P0 | Candidate comparison, N-candidate selection + patch regression suites on replay | FR-4.5, ADR-0014/0015 | position-bias both orders; no cross-dimension regression; the selected winner enforced at approval **and** independently at canon acceptance; losers never reach canon, summaries, retrieval, dependency edges or export | 3d |

## Phase 4 — Hardening

| ID | P | Item | Est |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B-4-1 | P0 | Long-form 120-chapter replay test; nightly live 20-chapter run (zero output-language failures) | 5d |
| B-4-2 | P0 | Chaos suite completion; provider fallback drills | 4d |
| B-4-3 | P0 | Backup/restore, secret rotation, runbooks | 3d |
| B-4-4 | P0 | Security test suite; dependency & secret scanning gates | 3d |
| B-4-5 | P0 | Bilingual reviewer evaluation round; threshold calibration to `contrast_calibrated`. **B-4-5a (contrast corpus to 100 distinct sets) is implemented and merged upstream** (PR #13); the remaining work is the human review and calibration round, which needs reviewers | 4d |
| B-4-6 | P1 | Cost calibration; dashboards | 3d |
| B-4-7 | P0 | Safe cancellation of already-running provider requests. **Automated scope implemented** (abort-signal propagation through gateway/retry/repair/fallback, Temporal activity and lease-loss signals, durable-intent probe, truthful cancelled-call accounting in migration 0012). Remaining: **confirmed remote cancellation and real post-abort billing against a live provider API**, which needs paid provider access | 2d |
| B-4-8 | P0 | Database least privilege, RLS, migration-safety and recovery-integrity hardening. **Automated scope implemented** (ADR-0050, migration 0014): append-only, immutable and canon-history tables no longer hold redundant request-scoped `UPDATE`/`DELETE`, `EXECUTE` is no longer granted to `PUBLIC` across the `canon` schema, sequence and default privileges narrowed, 22 new deterministic tests, restore drill extended from 23 to 40 invariants covering security metadata and re-executed post-restore behaviour. Remaining: **the same model verified on a deployed cluster**, which needs staging or production infrastructure | 1d |
| B-4-9 | P0 | Credential-free operational hardening (migration 0015). **Automated scope implemented**: shared rate/concurrency limiting in Postgres (per provider/model/workspace/operation class, request and token limits, explicit burst, concurrency as an expiring lease, idempotent by request id); shared budget reservations replacing the per-process `MemoryBudget` (expiring reservations, idempotent settlement, unknown cost never booked as zero, settled rows immutable); a deterministic local HTTP provider simulator with 18 fault scenarios plus the `HttpProvider` adapter that exercises the real transport boundary; readiness that refuses traffic on migration drift, schema-ahead, a tampered ledger or an `BYPASSRLS` application role. 74 new tests. **Partially implemented:** the new limiter and budget are not yet wired into the worker's production path. **Blocked on deployed infrastructure:** container topology (no container runtime in the workspace). **Blocked on live providers:** everything the simulator stands in for | 3d |
